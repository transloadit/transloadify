# Changelog

Here's is a combined todo/done list. You can see what todos are planned for the upcomming release, as well as ideas that may/may not make into a release in `Ideas`. As per SemVer, we allow breaking changes < 1.

## Ideas

- [ ] Add a logo for display up on http://transloadify.io (@kvz)
- [ ] A way to register at Transloadit straight from the CLI
- [ ] Can we get this tested on appveyor so we can try to get Windows support?

## v0.2.2

Released: TBA.

[Diff](https://github.com/transloadit/transloadify/compare/v0.2.0...master).

- [ ] Document the Template on-disk feature in the README.md (@adrusi)
- [ ] Fix remaining linting issues, then merge https://github.com/transloadit/transloadify/pull/7  (@adrusi)
- [x] Add linting via eslint with standardjs.com (Fix codebase via `eslint --fix`, make violations fatal on Travis CI tests) (@kvz)
- [x] Make tests running & passing on Travis (@adrusi)

## v0.2.1

Released: 2016-12-01. 

[Diff](https://github.com/transloadit/transloadify/compare/v0.1.14...v0.1.0).

- [x] release management via npm scripts (Since Go was claiming up until `v0.1.14`, we start at `v0.2.1` - SemVer says you can break BC < 1) (@kvz)
- [x] Add a simple website, based on README.md, CHANGELOG.md, FAQ.md (@kvz)
- [x] First Node.js based version of Transloadify (previously Go) (@adrusi)
